            <strong>Hi, my name is Bill!</strong> I graduated summa cum laude
            from the University of Missouri with a bachelor degree in
            mathematics. I have a proven record of teaching and tutoring math in
            middle school and high school with a focus on student success. I
            have received several school awards for student learning, and I have
            over fourteen years experience teaching and tutoring math as a
            certified math teacher.
          </p>

            I am experienced in on-site and remote tutoring using a variety of
            different learning platforms. My experience includes being a
            full-time math teacher in Dallas, Texas for
            <em
              >middle school math, Algebra 1, Trigonometry, and Pre-calculus</em
            >. I moved to Missouri after Texas and taught for many years in a
            high school classroom. I retired from actively instructing students
            in the classroom and began remotely teaching and tutoring for school
            districts throughout the United States for several companies that
            partnered with these schools to supply quality instruction to the
            students.
          </p>

            Some of the courses that I taught remotely are
            <em>sixth grade math, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and Geometry</em>. I
            have recently partnered with
            <strong>Wyzant and IXL Learning</strong> creating
            <strong>Algebra Beagle Tutoring</strong> to provide individualized
            math tutoring to a wide range of students, focusing on student
            growth and success for the classroom and also supporting the needs
            of the homeschool student.
